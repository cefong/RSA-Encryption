Description: 
Chat program using RSA encyption to secure data transmission between two Arduinos over Serial protocol. Full implementation which utilizes random key/modulus generation and handshaking to establish connection between Arduinos.

Included files:
	- encrypted_communication_part2.cpp
	- Makefile

Wiring Instructions:
Two Arduinos were used (for the sake of simplicity, call them Arduino 1 and Arduino 2)
GND(Arduino 1) -> GND(Arduino 2)
TX3(Arduino 1) -> RX3(Arduino 2)
TX3(Arduino 2) -> RX3(Arduino 1)
DIGITAL PIN13(Arduino 1) -> 550 ohm resistor -> 5V(Arduino 1)
DIGITAL PIN13(Arduino 2) -> GND(Arduino 2)

Notes:
The following functions: upper_sqrt, primality, gcd_euclid_fast, ext_euclid, multMod, powMod, wait_on_serial3, uint32_to_serial3, uint32_from_serial3, encrypt, decrypt were either adapted from code posted on eClass, or taken from previous assignment submissions.
